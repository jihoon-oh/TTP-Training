	<ol>
		<li><b>There are five different species of rhinoceros</b>
			<ul><li>Three are from southern Asia and two are from Africa. They are the Black Rhinoceros, White Rhinoceros, Indian Rhinoceros, Javan Rhinoceros and Sumatran Rhinoceros.</li></ul>
		</li>
		<br>
		<li><b>The name rhinoceros means ‘nose horn’ and is often shortened to rhino.</b>
			<ul><li>It comes from the Greek words rhino (nose) and ceros (horn).</li></ul>
		</li>
		<br>
		<li><b>White rhinoceros are the second largest land mammal</b>
			<ul><li>The white rhino is the largest rhino species and can weigh over 3500 kg (7700 lb) and is the largest land mammal after the elephant.  Elephants can grow to be 7,000 kg (15,000 lb)</li></ul>
		</li>
		<br>
		<li><b>Three of the five rhinoceros species are listed as being critically endangered.</b>
			<ul><li>The Black Rhinoceros, Javan Rhinoceros and Sumatran Rhinoceros are all Critically Endangered which means they have 50% chance of becoming extinct in three generations.</li></ul>
		</li>
		<br>
		<li><b>Rhinoceros have thick, sensitive skin.</b>
			<ul><li>Rhino skin maybe thick but it can be quite sensitive to sunburns and insect bites which is why they like wallow so much – when the mud dries it acts as protection from the sunburns and insects.</li></ul>
		</li>
		<br>
		<li><b>Relative to their large body size, rhinoceros have small brains.</b>
			<ul><li>But this doesn’t mean they are stupid</li></ul>
		</li>
		<br>
		<li><b>Rhinoceros horns are made from a protein called keratin, the same substance that fingernails and hair are made of.</b>
			<ul><li>The rhino’s horn is not bone and is not attached to its skull; it is also not hollow like elephant tusks. It is actually a compacted mass of hairs that continues to grow throughout the animal’s lifetime, just like our own hair and nails. The longest known on a black rhino was 4 feet 9 inches long (they average about 20 inches in length on the black rhino).</li></ul>
